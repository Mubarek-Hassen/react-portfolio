    3. Skills - Describe and list skills possessed

## What Technologies are used ?

- As a second portfolio after having the first one removed by Heroku, i've decided to build a permanent one with constant updating and future expansions. To achieve the goal set, i also wanted to make it appealing to the eye. The technologies used in the process are helpful for that purpose and will be integral in the future as well. These are the thechnologies implemented in the development of this site.
  1. React (Hooks, Router v.6)
  2. Material UI
  3. Material Icons
  4. Framer Motion

## Stretch goals

- For the expansion, I am planning to add these certain functionalities to expand the portfolio.
  A. Demo/Playground - to showcase more of the works and examples of what could be done with react and other functionalities.
  B. Blog - This would be a weekly published article about a topic that i picked and would like to share. It also could be in Amharic, English or maybe both. (The      ability to translate and choose from either, like dark mode or light mode, except it is for the language preference)
  C. Theme - Ligh or Dark mode

- For the moment, these ideas are what in mind. Please feel free to contribute, critic and comment as i would like to hear from you and improve.
